## How it works
The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behaviour.
It is defined by two coupled equations — `x = 1 - a·x² + y` and `y = b·x` —
which, under the classical parameters `a = 1.4` and `b = 0.3`, produce a bounded
strange attractor. This implementation computes the map in 10-bit signed fixed-point
(Q2.8) and serialises the resulting (x, y) samples as raw bit streams for off-chip readout.

The top module instantiates three sub-blocks:

- **Henon_map** — computes the two recurrences `x = 1 - a·x² + y` and `y = b·x` using fixed-point arithmetic with constants `a = 1.4` and `b =.3`. Asserts `done_henon` once the first valid sample is available.
- **ser_x** — receives the 10-bit `x[9:0]` output and serialises it as a raw bit stream on `Q_ser_x`, with `eos_ser_x` flagging end-of-sequence.
- **ser_y** — identical serialiser for the 10-bit `y[9:0]` output, independently enabled via `ena_ser_y`.

All internal arithmetic uses **Q2.8** (10-bit signed, scale = 256). The Hénon attractor is bounded to x ∈ [−1.5, 1.5] and y ∈ [−0.4, 0.4].


## How to test

### 1. Reset the system

Set:
- `rst_n = 0` for a few clock cycles  
- Then set `rst_n = 1`

Initial state:
x = 0, y = 0

---

### 2. Generate Henon data

Set:
- `ena_henon = 1`

Then:
- New values are generated every clock cycle
- `done_henon` indicates valid outputs

---

### 3. Capture a sample

Wait until:
- `done_henon = 1`

At that moment:
- `x_out` and `y_out` contain valid data

---

### 4. Serialize X output

1. Pulse:
   ena_ser_x = 1 (for 1 clock cycle)

2. Then:
   ena_ser_x = 0

3. Observe:
- `Q_ser_x`: outputs 10 bits (LSB first)
- One bit per clock cycle

4. Wait for:
- `eos_x = 1`

---

### 5. Serialize Y output

Repeat the same process:

1. Pulse:
   ena_ser_y = 1

2. Read:
- `Q_ser_y`

3. Wait for:
- `eos_y = 1`

---

### 6. Expected behavior

- First outputs may be zero due to initialization
- Subsequent values follow Henon chaotic dynamics
- Serial output:
  - 10 bits per value
  - LSB first
  - `eos_*` marks completion

| `ena_ser_x` | in | Start serialisation of x |
| `Q_ser_x` | out | Serial bit stream for x |
| `eos_ser_x` | out | End-of-sequence flag for x |
| `ena_ser_y` | in | Start serialisation of y |
| `Q_ser_y` | out | Serial bit stream for y |

## External hardware

To test this design on real hardware, the following is required:

### Required hardware

- Tiny Tapeout demo board (with the fabricated chip installed)
- USB cable for power and communication
- A computer to configure and monitor the board

---

### Optional but recommended

- Logic analyzer (recommended) to observe serial outputs:
  - `Q_ser_x`
  - `Q_ser_y`

- Alternatively:
  - LEDs (to visualize activity)
  - Oscilloscope (to inspect timing and bitstream)
